ND Mobile XModule Prototypes created during Modo Labs 2023 Summer Internship 

My first prototype idea was to create a 'For You' Module, where students can get up-to-date information regarding clubs/activities on Notre Dame's campus and volunteer opportunities happening around the South Bend area. All of this code resides in index.js

Used the Google Events API to gather information from a Google Search of "Volunteer in South Bend."
Used Puppeteer to parse the information from 'events.nd.edu'

My second prototype idea was to create a 'Student Class Schedule', where students can directly see their schedule in a clear format. This code is used in index.js and schedule.js

Used Airtable to create a mock database to create information on a student and their schedule.
